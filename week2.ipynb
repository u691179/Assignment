Roughly speaking, it looks at the value $f(x)$ of a given $x$ and checks whether $f(x)$ it is above or below 0. If it is below 0, it needs to change $x$ in such a way that $f(x)$ increases. It uses the derivative $f'(x)$ to figure out whether it should increase or decrease $x$ to get to $f(x)=0$. So suppose that $f(x) < 0$ and $f'(x) >0$ then it will increase $x$ (move to the right) to a solution to $f(x) =0$.\n",
